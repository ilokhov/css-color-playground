CSS color playground is an online color tool demo. It is meant to showcase a clean user interface and is implemented using pure JavaScript without relying on libraries such as jQuery for manipulating the DOM.

Since the project uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS filters it is unlikely to function properly in older browsers such as Internet Explorer.

This project is inspired by and takes shapes from ["How I Work with Color"](https://medium.com/@JustinMezzell/how-i-work-with-color-8439c98ae5ed) and uses the [jscolor library](http://jscolor.com/) as well as [this helper function](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12266311) to generate pastel colors.
